# TSK_FSLS_SGCN
In this paper, addressing the issue of imbalanced data in semi-supervised learning, we combine the TSK fuzzy system with corresponding algorithms designed for different data classification tasks to propose a based on TSK Fuzzy Systems Integration of Label Smoothing, Feature Smoothing, and Semi-Supervised Graph Convolution Networks(TSK-LSFS-SGCN).
