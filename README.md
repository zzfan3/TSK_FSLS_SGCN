# TSK_FSLS_SGCN
In this paper, addressing the issue of imbalanced data in semi-supervised learning, we combine the TSK fuzzy system with corresponding algorithms designed for different data classification tasks to propose a based on TSK Fuzzy Systems Integration of Label Smoothing, Feature Smoothing, and Semi-Supervised Graph Convolution Networks(TSK-LSFS-SGCN).

code from GAOSI, please use the new version of matlab to run this program (this program development environment is in matalbR2022b), the old version of matlab may have some code incompatibility.
